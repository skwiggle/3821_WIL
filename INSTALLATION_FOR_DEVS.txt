-- setting up python --------------

1. uninstall all versions of python
2. type into windows search: "environment variables" and click on "Edit the system environment variables"
3. go to ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES > USER VARIABLES > path > EDIT and then delete all python paths if there is any
   (usually the paths will end with python.exe or python/lib etc.)
4. create a new folder at C:/python
5. download the python 3.7.3 installer
6. open the installer and choose "customize installation" and change these 2 things
    - install in C:/python folder
    - tick "add to environment variables"
7. done

-- setting up project -----------------

1. clone project to a folder (don't open in pycharm yet)
2. in pycharm go to open folder > choose the 3821_WIL folder
   (you'll know it's recognised as a project folder cause the icon will look
    different to a normal folder, if it doesn't then you might need to do step 3)
3. if it says there's no interpreter, click
   "add interpreter" > existing interpreter > open the python.exe file at
   '3821_WIL/app/kivy_venv/Scripts/python.exe' in your project and then press OK.
4. open up a command prompt window (not the one in pycharm) and type: pip install watchdog
5. try running the main.py file within pycharm and it should work
