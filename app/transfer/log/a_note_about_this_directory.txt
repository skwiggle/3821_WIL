I was thinking about adding this directory to store a temporary log
file cause in the vision it says we need to be able to read the previous
log. so basically everytime it reads a log from the remote terminal and gets
sent to the application... the app writes it to a temporary file and
saves it here. Whenever the file is overwritten, all data beforehand is
destroyed

-------------------- OPTION 2 -------------------
the second option is to keep all logs in 1 file but seperate each line
with an identifier for example

log1---
text blah blah text
log2---

and then use regex to retrieve each log (and maybe store up to 3, 4 or 5 logs
at a time so it doesn't affect performance)

if I remember correctly the command would be

log = re.split('log[\d]---', thelogfiletext, flags=re.MULTILINE)

which will return an array of text [log1, log2, log3]
which than the app can just reference
